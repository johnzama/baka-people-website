      <h2>Religion and Spirituality of the Baka People</h2>
      <p>
        The Baka people’s spirituality is deeply intertwined with their natural environment. Their religious beliefs are based on animism, where the forest and its inhabitants are seen as being alive with spirits. This worldview reflects ancient human spiritual traditions, where early societies revered nature as a source of life and power, and believed in the presence of spiritual beings in the natural world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Central to Baka spirituality is the belief in **Jengi**, the spirit of the forest. The Baka believe that Jengi is the protector of the forest and the people who live in it. They regularly invoke the spirit of Jengi during ceremonies, especially before hunting expeditions, asking for protection and success. The Jengi ritual is a central aspect of Baka life, connecting them to the forest in both spiritual and practical ways.

        Music plays an important role in their spiritual practices. The Baka use polyphonic singing to communicate with the spirits, often accompanied by dance and rhythmic instruments. These rituals not only serve a spiritual purpose but also reinforce the community’s connection to their ancestral beliefs. Similar to early humans, the Baka people’s spiritual practices serve to explain the forces of nature and provide guidance in their daily lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        While external influences have introduced Christianity and other religions into their region, many Baka continue to practice their traditional beliefs, maintaining a spiritual connection to the forest. Their religious practices offer a living link to the spiritual traditions of ancient humans, whose beliefs were also deeply connected to the natural world.
